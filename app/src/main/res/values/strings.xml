    <string name="tv_pointearthquake_1">•\If you\'re outdoors, stay in the open away from power lines or anything that might fall. Stay away from buildings (stuff might fall off the building or the building could fall on you).</string>
    <string name="tv_pointearthquake_2">•\Don\'t use matches, candles, or any flame. Broken gas lines and fire don\'t mix.</string>
    <string name="tv_pointearthquake_3">•\If you\'re in a car, stop the car and stay inside the car until the earthquake stops.</string>

    <string name="tv_pointflodd_3">•\Do not walk through flooded areas. It can be difficult to tell how deep the water is and what lies underneath the water that could hurt you. Even shallow, moving water can make you fall.</string>
    <string name="tv_pointflood_4">•\If you have to walk in water, wherever possible, walk where the water is not moving. Use a stick to check the firmness of the ground in front of you.</string>
